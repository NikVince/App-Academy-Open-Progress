# Getting Started at App Academy

**Date Completed**: 12/05/2025
**Module**: Web Development Fundamentals
**Practices Completed**: 10/10 (Learning at App Academy: 6/6, Introduction to Problem Solving I: 4/4)

## Key Concepts Learned

### Learning at App Academy
- **Active Learning Philosophy**: App Academy emphasizes hands-on practice over passive consumption of content
- **Spaced Repetition**: Concepts are revisited and built upon throughout the curriculum to reinforce understanding
- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Focus on breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable components
- **Community-Driven Learning**: Utilizing Discord and peer support as integral parts of the learning process
- **Growth Mindset**: Embracing mistakes and debugging as essential parts of the learning journey

### Introduction to Problem Solving I
- **Decomposition**: Breaking large problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying similarities between current problems and previously solved ones
- **Abstraction**: Focusing on essential features while ignoring irrelevant details
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating step-by-step procedures to solve problems systematically
- **Testing and Validation**: Verifying solutions work correctly across different scenarios

## Practical Applications

**Learning Strategies Applied:**
- Established daily learning routines and consistent practice schedules
- Set up systems for tracking progress and identifying areas needing reinforcement
- Developed note-taking methods that encourage active engagement with material

**Problem-Solving Framework:**
- Read problems carefully and identify what exactly is being asked
- Break complex requirements into smaller, testable components
- Work through examples manually before writing code
- Test solutions with edge cases and boundary conditions

## Code Examples

*Note: This foundational module focused on learning methodology rather than specific coding implementations*

**Problem-Solving Process Example:**
```
1. Understand the Problem
   - What are the inputs?
   - What should the output be?
   - Are there any constraints or edge cases?

2. Plan the Solution
   - What steps are needed?
   - Can I break this into smaller problems?
   - Have I solved something similar before?

3. Implement and Test
   - Write the solution step by step
   - Test with provided examples
   - Consider edge cases
   - Debug and refine as needed
```

## Connections to Previous Learning

This foundational module establishes the learning framework that supports all subsequent technical content. The problem-solving methodology introduced here becomes the backbone for approaching JavaScript functions, HTML structure, CSS styling challenges, and eventually full-stack development problems.

## Questions and Reflections

**Key Insights:**
- Learning to code effectively requires as much focus on *how* to learn as *what* to learn
- The debugging mindset is actually a strength - errors provide valuable information about how to improve
- Breaking problems down systematically is a skill that improves with deliberate practice

**Areas for Continued Growth:**
- Developing patience with the learning process during challenging concepts
- Building confidence in approaching unfamiliar problems
- Strengthening ability to explain solutions clearly to others

## Next Steps

This module prepares for diving into JavaScript fundamentals with a solid foundation in:
- Structured problem-solving approaches
- Active learning techniques
- Community engagement strategies
- Growth mindset principles

The problem-solving framework established here will be immediately applied to JavaScript data types, functions, and control flow in upcoming modules.
