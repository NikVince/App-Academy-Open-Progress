## Key Concepts Learned

### Problem Solving (Web Context)
- **Visual Problem Decomposition**: Breaking down visual designs into HTML structure and CSS styling components
- **Content vs Presentation**: Understanding the separation between HTML (structure/content) and CSS (presentation/styling)
- **Design Analysis**: Looking at websites and identifying the underlying HTML elements and CSS properties used
- **Mobile-First Thinking**: Considering how designs should work across different screen sizes from the start
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensuring web content is usable by people with diverse abilities and technologies

### HTML Basics
- **Semantic Markup**: Using elements that convey meaning (header, nav, main, article, section, footer)
- **Document Structure**: Understanding DOCTYPE, html, head, and body elements and their purposes
- **Text Elements**: Headings (h1-h6), paragraphs, lists (ol, ul, li), and inline formatting (strong, em, span)
- **Links and Navigation**: Anchor elements, relative vs absolute URLs, and creating intuitive navigation
- **Images and Media**: img elements with proper alt text, understanding src attributes and responsive images
- **HTML Validation**: Writing valid, well-formed HTML that follows web standards

### CSS Basics
- **Selectors and Specificity**: Element, class, ID selectors and understanding which styles take precedence
- **Box Model**: Content, padding, border, margin and how they affect element sizing and spacing
- **Typography**: Font properties, text styling, and creating readable, attractive text presentations
- **Colors and Backgrounds**: Color values (hex, rgb, named), background properties, and visual contrast
- **Layout Fundamentals**: Block vs inline elements, basic positioning, and element flow
- **CSS Organization**: Writing maintainable CSS with consistent naming and logical structure

## Practical Applications

**Semantic HTML Structure:**
- Created well-structured web pages that screen readers and search engines can easily parse
- Built navigation systems that are intuitive and accessible
- Organized content hierarchically using appropriate heading levels and sectioning elements

**Visual Design Implementation:**
- Translated visual designs into CSS code that matches intended appearance
- Created responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes
- Implemented consistent visual styling systems using CSS variables and reusable classes

**Performance and Accessibility:**
- Optimized images with appropriate alt text and file sizes
- Wrote CSS that loads efficiently and doesn't block page rendering
- Ensured color contrast and typography choices support readability

## Code Examples

**Semantic HTML Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Portfolio - Jane Developer</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <section id="about">
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio...</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="projects">
            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Project Name</h3>
                <p>Project description...</p>
            </article>
        </section>
    </main>
    
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 Jane Developer</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS Layout and Styling:**
```css
/* CSS Reset and Base Styles */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

/* Navigation */
nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
}

nav a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #007bff;
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

nav a:hover {
    color: #0056b3;
}

/* Layout */
main {
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem;
}

section {
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
}
```

## Connections to Previous Learning

**JavaScript Integration:**
- HTML provides the structure that JavaScript will manipulate in future modules
- CSS classes and IDs become targets for JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Understanding HTML elements and their properties is essential for dynamic web applications

**Development Workflow:**
- Version control skills from Module 3 are essential for tracking changes to HTML and CSS files
- Command line tools help with file organization and project management
- Code editor features enhance HTML and CSS development efficiency

**Problem-Solving Application:**
- Visual problem decomposition builds on general problem-solving skills from Module 1
- Breaking designs into components mirrors function decomposition from JavaScript modules

## Questions and Reflections

**Key Insights:**
- Semantic HTML is not just about correctness - it fundamentally improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability
- CSS specificity and the cascade require strategic thinking about code organization and architecture
- The separation of content and presentation creates more flexible, maintainable web applications

**Design Challenges:**
- Translating visual designs into code requires both technical skills and design intuition
- Cross-browser compatibility and responsive design add complexity layers to consider
- Balancing visual appeal with performance and accessibility requires careful trade-offs

**Areas for Continued Growth:**
- Developing intuition for CSS layout solutions and debugging techniques
- Building design systems that scale across multiple pages and components
- Understanding modern CSS features and when to use them vs fallback approaches

## Next Steps

This HTML and CSS foundation prepares for:
- **Intermediate HTML & CSS**: Forms, advanced layouts, and responsive design patterns
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to dynamically modify HTML and CSS
- **Front-end Frameworks**: Understanding how modern tools build upon these fundamentals
- **Full-stack Development**: Creating the front-end interfaces that connect to back-end services

The combination of semantic HTML and well-organized CSS creates the visual layer that users interact with in all web applications.
